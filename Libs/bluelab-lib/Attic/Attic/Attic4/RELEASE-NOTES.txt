- FIX Micxcraft
Insert plug A, insert plug B, remove plug A, play with plug B => crash
The ref counting works only between plugins of the same name
=> so create a windows corresponding to each plug name, to avoid
destroying windows of other plugs not similarly ref counted
- FIX: re-ordered calls when destructing GL => crashed Mixcraft

- FIX: FftConvolver6: fixed crackles when host buffer was small (447)

- 20181204: tested all plugins for unusual buffer size (447), and fixes
 
- 20200923: created bluelab-lib from NikoLib
for testing UST compilation with IPlug2

- 20200926
- finished porting all the classes to IPlug2
