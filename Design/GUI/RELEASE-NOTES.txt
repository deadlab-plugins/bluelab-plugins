TODO: separator: more clear



=== TODO ===
- TODO: drop down menu, make items in lower case (no upper case as it is currently)
First letter in upper case. Find a good font (see the font of the Ghost-X buttons)
- TODO: rollover on help button
- TODO: programatically: adjust style of Ghost meters (borders etc.)
- TODO: for drop down menu, set blue to real rollover blue color
rollover blue: 6a6affff and set text to black
- TODO: check plugs CPU % when "resting"
- TODO: check gui refresh for all plugins
- TODO: pass valgrind for mem for all
(already done for the last ones, update the list!)
- NOTE: blue for all widgets: lighter blue, not the BlueLab title one
Good to keep 2 blue: 1 for the logo, 1 for the "active" color and knob color
- IDEA: for GUI resize plugs, do not make several backgrounds
Just position programmatically "BlueLab + plugname", and "help button" (as bitmaps)
- NOTE: Spatializer: xy pad center lines are rounded at the end
