- set well the FPS for global build (25 fps for windows7 + low windows configs)
Maybe 25 fps for old Macs. 60fps for Windows 10 + high windows configs. 60 fps for Catalina.
=> or set fps dynamically (in the GUI, or in a config file)

- Metal for new Macs, OpenGL for old Macs

Port plugins:
- plug name .png, manual, RELEASE-NOTEX.txt
- bl_config.h
- GUID
- use 2 functions for MyMakeGraphics() & MyMakeLayout()
- remove printf("create controls")
- remove UpdateText()
- remove MakeDefaultPReset()
- double -> BL_FLOAT
- remove kNumPrograms

TODO: gain smother: use CParamSmooth

Knobs style: see Ableton (minimalist and useful)! (but with graduations)

- BUG: (Mac Sierra, Nanovg, GL2), import 2 plugins with OpenGL view and GUI resize, resize one  => the two plugins get big display bugs

- OPTIM: check very well 60fps and perfs for each plugin (e.g Wav3s now consumes too much)
- TODO; in ProcessBlock(), every plugin, check that protools bug is fixed (out data must be set to null)

ParamSmooth => new version / CParamSmooth / sampleRate
- parameter emacs indentation (tab = 4 speaces), and re-indent everything

BUG: when quitting a Cario plug, into the XCode debugger, it crashes
- REFACT: bien classer les variables memebres (parametres, fft objs etcâ€¦), pour tous les plugins

- TODO: disable auto CPU anti-denormalization !
(and check denormalization by hand)

- TODO: set bevel for all curves

- TODO: the plugin needs to even process the sound when UI is closed (make test with reaper, [UI] button). e.g Rebalance

- TODO: Cairo, fix correctly the crash when quitting 
(now, there is currently a memory leak)

- when gray out knob, think to gray out value text also

- apply the new mutexes and flags from Ghost to all other plugins

Compile for Windows Xp:
Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7 => is ok!
Platform Toolset: Visual Studio 2013 - Windows Xp (v120p)
=> need Xp SP3 + 3D graphics driver for execution (and suppress GetTickCount64())

- Why is it so long to display a plug the first time (we have black windows for some time before the GUI is displayed (that was not the case with iPlug1)

TODO: test very optimized nanovg: https://github.com/zlgopen/awtk/tree/master/3rd/nanovg

PERFORMANCES/FPS: really consider passing everything to 25fps! (
we can gain x2 performances - See Ghost -)

Undefined behavior sanitizer on old XCode: 
add -fsanitize=undefined on cflags an linker flags

TODO for all plugs at the end: pass thread sanitizer & undefined behavior sanitizer & address sanitizer

TODO: for all plugins, check that the display is not redisplayed every time (with debug blinking rectangles). check that is only displayed whn there is new data.

Website: Emrah => add a category menu (for the moment this is not practical)
