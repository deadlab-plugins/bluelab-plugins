- set well the FPS for global build (25 fps for windows7 + low windows configs)
Maybe 25 fps for old Macs. 60fps for Windows 10 + high windows configs. 60 fps for Catalina.
=> or set fps dynamically (in the GUI, or in a config file)

- Metal for new Macs, OpenGL for old Macs

- BUG: (Mac Sierra, Nanovg, GL2), import 2 plugins with OpenGL view and GUI resize, resize one  => the two plugins get big display bugs

- OPTIM: check very well 60fps and perfs for each plugin (e.g Wav3s now consumes too much)
- TODO; in ProcessBlock(), every plugin, check that protools bug is fixed (out data must be set to null)

BUG: when quitting a Cario plug, into the XCode debugger, it crashes
- REFACT: bien classer les variables memebres (parametres, fft objs etc…), pour tous les plugins

- TODO: disable auto CPU anti-denormalization !
(and check denormalization by hand)

- TODO: the plugin needs to even process the sound when UI is closed (make test with reaper, [UI] button). e.g Rebalance

- TODO: Cairo, fix correctly the crash when quitting 
(now, there is currently a memory leak)

- when gray out knob, think to gray out value text also

- apply the new mutexes and flags from Ghost to all other plugins

Compile for Windows Xp:
Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7 => is ok!
Platform Toolset: Visual Studio 2013 - Windows Xp (v120p)
=> need Xp SP3 + 3D graphics driver for execution (and suppress GetTickCount64())

- Why is it so long to display a plug the first time (we have black windows for some time before the GUI is displayed (that was not the case with iPlug1)

TODO: test very optimized nanovg: https://github.com/zlgopen/awtk/tree/master/3rd/nanovg

PERFORMANCES/FPS: really consider passing everything to 25fps! (
we can gain x2 performances - See Ghost -)

TODO: if the bug Cubase/Ableton 10 + Windows 10 + Intel + OpenGL is not solved, try Direct X for nanovg

BUG (maybe): the first time we click on a text value, this is buggy, we need to click a second time

TODO: un-denormalize input of each plugin, just at the beginning

NOTE: Windows / Reboot
- reboot shortcut: Win + x, u, u
- if windows does not boot: go to linux and do: 
ntfsfix (on ntfs) partition and dosfsck (on dos partition)
- windows safe mode: hard reboot several times => then choose “startup option”, 
reboot again, press “4” for safe mode boot

- maybe use dark grey instead of black for background! (grey "6 6 6" or "9 9 9")
(izotope uses a dark grey, but with more blue ("4/5 6 7")
captain blood uses real black
- use a band at the bottom on the whole width (include logo, plug name, version, logo)

Website: for categories "menu", add a submenu to "PLUGINS" on the bar, and add the most used category pages as submenu entries (should be feasible as it is!)

WIP: the bright white color is too bright?
(compare with other plugins...) maybe set it just a bit darker (except for the plugin title)
to test it: push the screen at the maximum => it should not be too bright

--perf--
Modify system config files:
set number in /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid from 4 to -1
set number in /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict from 1 to 0

perf record

Hotspot:
perf record --call-graph dwarf <app>
then: hotspot

Launch for 10 seconds, at 99Hz
perf record -F 99 --call-graph dwarf -p $(pgrep BL-Air) sleep 10

perf record -g

perf stat -p $(pgrep BL-Air)
-> cycles

Compile with -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer

Steps:
1 -
perf stat -e cpu-cycles,instructions,L1-dcache-loads,L1-dcache-load-misses,L1-dcache-stores <command>
=> outputs result
=> optimize, re do perf stat, compare

perf report: press 'a' to see anotated code

2 - 
perf record -g -e L1-dcache-load-misses ../plugs-dev/bluelab/BL-Plugins/BL-Air/build-linux/BL-Air-app/BL-Air 

perf record -g -e instructions ../plugs-dev/bluelab/BL-Plugins/BL-Air/build-linux/BL-Air-app/BL-Air

For all plugins (=> new Design): 
- TODO: remame knob.png => big-knob.png in bl_config.h and CMakeList.txt

- TODO: arguments to frequency scale
- TODO: CreateVersion(), now we have suppressed the position argument
- NOTE: must export knobs with odd number of frames (so the middle frames is exactly the zero position of the knob)
- Don't forget to remove the version from the background
- use new SoftMasking comp
- DONE: add fonts to bl_config, CMakeList.txt, and to resources folder, and load them in main()
- TODO: for all plugs: INF => BL_INF
- TODO: check memory of all plugins, but when manipulating all knobs/options
------------------
------------------

- TODO(all): everywhere use Curve::SetValues5() instead of SetValues4() everywhere
- TODO(all): everywhere, Scale::ApplyScale -> check if we can use the ForEach versions
- TODO(all): everywhere: use SoftMaskComp4 (warning, input and outputs have changed)
- TODO(all): every spectrograms: use filter bank for log scale frequencies (faster)
- TODO(all): use FilterBank instead of MelScale (no stairs effect)
- TODO(all): check that we use the latest TimeAxis and FreqAxis
SmoothCurveDb => additional arg: sampleRate
- TODO(all): set output data to zero at the beginning, for all plugins
- TODO(all): should use BLUtils::Fades with sigmoid (see Ghost) => far better!
- TODO(all): do not use DecimateSamples2() => use DecimateSamples() or DecimateSamples3(). (we use it at least in Graphcurve5)
- TODO: check log scale (with many lines, w/ gamma = 1)

- TODO: set bevel for all curves
- TODO for all plugs at the end: pass thread sanitizer & undefined behavior sanitizer & address sanitizer

- TODO: for all plugins, check that the display is not redisplayed every time (with debug blinking rectangles). check that is only displayed whn there is new data.

IDEA Design: For monitor, don't use a checkbox, but a button to toggle on and off

NOTE: knob design for Inkscape: https://synthpanels.design/

Inscape tips:
"Pattern along path":
- before, raise patter objet to top! (to set correct selection order)
(pattern must be on the top of the selection)
- convert both objects to path
- choose "repeated"
NOTE: inkscape "Patter to path" for knob: parameters: 5.2, 0, 19.1

TODO Design:
- Info bulles!
- rollover on checkboxes?
- StereoWidth: more space circle/width meter/correlation meter ?
- Footer -> header?
- Graph: font more fat?
