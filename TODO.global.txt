- set well the FPS for global build (25 fps for windows7 + low windows configs)
Maybe 25 fps for old Macs. 60fps for Windows 10 + high windows configs. 60 fps for Catalina.
=> or set fps dynamically (in the GUI, or in a config file)

- Metal for new Macs, OpenGL for old Macs

- BUG: (Mac Sierra, Nanovg, GL2), import 2 plugins with OpenGL view and GUI resize, resize one  => the two plugins get big display bugs

- OPTIM: check very well 60fps and perfs for each plugin (e.g Wav3s now consumes too much)
- TODO; in ProcessBlock(), every plugin, check that protools bug is fixed (out data must be set to null)

BUG: when quitting a Cario plug, into the XCode debugger, it crashes
- REFACT: bien classer les variables memebres (parametres, fft objs etc…), pour tous les plugins

- TODO: disable auto CPU anti-denormalization !
(and check denormalization by hand)

- TODO: the plugin needs to even process the sound when UI is closed (make test with reaper, [UI] button). e.g Rebalance

- TODO: Cairo, fix correctly the crash when quitting 
(now, there is currently a memory leak)

- when gray out knob, think to gray out value text also

- apply the new mutexes and flags from Ghost to all other plugins

Compile for Windows Xp:
Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7 => is ok!
Platform Toolset: Visual Studio 2013 - Windows Xp (v120p)
=> need Xp SP3 + 3D graphics driver for execution (and suppress GetTickCount64())

- Why is it so long to display a plug the first time (we have black windows for some time before the GUI is displayed (that was not the case with iPlug1)

- convert both objects to path
- choose "repeated"
NOTE: inkscape "Patter to path" for knob: parameters: 5.2, 0, 19.1

TODO: don't forget to test with no GUI, only the UI from the host
TODO: activate OpenBlas for Rebalance Windows 
TODO: win: test Reaper resize gui (works with Spatializer, but not with Chroma)

FIXED:
- "config.h"
- vst3 scan crash
- Rebalance
- Spatializer
- win32 gui freeze fix
- Ghost app

Recompiled all: ok
Reaper rescan all plugins: ok, no crash


==== Rebalance / OpenBLAS: ====
What is finally done:
for Win64: compile with clang/Ninja, generic (not generic old)
for Win32: unsolvable linking problem => do not use OpenBLAS

Details:

tried this method with clang
https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-use-OpenBLAS-in-Microsoft-Visual-Studio
install lld in conda
set LIB=%LIB%;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.18362.0\um\x64"

.\vcvarsall.bat x86_amd64 10.0.18362.0

finally, other method:
launch visual studio command prompt (x86_x64)
run conda activate (it is here: C:\Users\BillGatesMaTuer\miniconda3\condabin)
C:\Users\BillGatesMaTuer\miniconda3\condabin\conda.bat activate
then run cmake 

cmake ..\..\OpenBLAS -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=flang -DCMAKE_MT=mt -DBUILD_WITHOUT_LAPACK=no -DNOFORTRAN=0 -DDYNAMIC_ARCH=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
=> success!

cmake ..\..\OpenBLAS -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=flang -DCMAKE_MT=mt -DBUILD_WITHOUT_LAPACK=no -DNOFORTRAN=0 -DDYNAMIC_ARCH=ON  -DDYNAMIC_OLDER=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

modified by hand \CMakeFiles\rules.ninja and added /MT to all cl-clang.exe calls
also modified build.ninja for many /MD -> /MT

For Win32: use cmake gui, and simply configure/generate, and build with Visual Studio. It will use the generic config (not optimal).
But for win32, it does not work with ninja and clang
=> it fails when liking with Rebalance (some symbols not found)
