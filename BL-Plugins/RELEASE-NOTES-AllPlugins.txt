Global release notes, for all plugins, for global modifications

2021/08/11

- IMPROV: made a global RELEASE_NOTES.txt for all BL-Plugins in common
(for global modifs)
- IMPROV: incremenented all versions numbers
- FIX: Help button rollover stays blue after having clicked on it
Mac2 - Win10: all plugs:
- NOTE: tested Mac1 Win7 andWin10:
=> it seems that we don't need vcredist
- IMPROV: improved and fixed Air installer
- IMPROV: improved and fixed win installer (example of BL-Air)
      - renamed BL-Air.dll -> BL-Air-vst2.dll
      (more clear if we distribute the file without installer)
      - renamed "User Guide" -> "Documentation" (start menu and installer)
      - added the plugin name like in "BL-Air Documentation"
      (because on Windows 10, in the start menu, all the plugins doc
      was named the same "User Guide")
      - modified deefault install dir {pf}/BL-Air -> {pf}/BlueLab/BL-Air
      - also install licence.rtf in the dst directory
      - make possible to install 32 bit versions on 64 bit systems
      (there was not installed, even if checked, on 64 bit system)
      (that can be used if the user installed a 32 bit host on a 64 bit system)
      - fixed vst3 destination dir: 32 and 64 bit was installed in the same dir
      - for vst2, set default to {pf}/VSTPlugins (removed "Steinberg)
      See: https://helpcenter.steinberg.de/hc/fr/articles/115000177084-VST-plug-in-locations-on-Windows
      And: https://help.ableton.com/hc/fr-fr/articles/209071729-Utilisation-de-plug-ins-VST-sous-Windows   
- BUG(not a bug) installer: win32 (Mac2 - Win10)
VST3: "can not create a file when that file already exists"
This was when the original vst3 in place was build with bl build system,
launched as administrator.
Remove the vst3, install once, install a secondtime over = no problem
=> this shouldn't be a problem for the users, only on bl build machine
- IMPROV: applied the installer improvements from Air to all the plugins
- FIX: win installer, VST3 and AAX
VST3: "can not create a file when that file already exists"
win32 (Mac2 - Win10)
- FIX: fiedd win installers for vst3 and aax (directory tree was wrong)
- FIX: fixed all win vst projects
- FIX: Ghost installer, win32: fixed .exe
- FIX: all plugins: win installer: icons for vst3 and aax
- FIX: SampleDelay build failed
- IMPROV: improved build system for linux
- IMPROV: changed name of install-app.sh
- IMPROV: improved installer image with the new logo
- IMPROV: updated all the icns with new logo (from linux)
- IMPROV: updated all the .ico with the new logo (from linux)
- IMPROV: win: added license file to the zip
- FIX: Linux: VST3, the graph was updated (but the sound was)
This was because a wrong fir in iPlug2/vst3 (to fix a crash when closing/re-opening plug window)
=> now it is correctly fixed, it doesn't crash, and displays well
- IMPROV: fixed build scripts linux
- FIX: linux: fixed bug when stripping binaries
- TEST: tested vst3 preferences saving: ok!
Tested with Impulses: everything ok when reload!
- FIX: vst3:linux: OnParmamChange() was called twice each time
(BL_FIX_VST3_PARAM_CHANGE)
- FIX: fixed parameters name display (Bitwig Studio, linux)
(BL_FIX_BITWIG_LINUX_PARAM_NAMES)
Parameters names were like "%" or "dB" instead of parameters names
(not such problem with vst3)
- IMPROV: linux:vst2:bitwig studio: there was a "Param5" parameter
(dummy parameter for the graph)
And for Reaper, that was an empty parameter.
=> just removed it, it looks ok.
- FIX: fixed some typos in the prev fix (remove kGraph)
- FIX: fixed OnReset() that was not called when transport restarted
(Bitwig/vst2/linux)
- FIX: gui resize rollover buttons, current button was not highlighted anymore
- FIX: infinite loop when inserting VST3 (Renoise-V3.3.2/linux)
- FIX: crash when closing VST3 GUI (Renoise-V3.3.2/linux)
- FIX: crash when removing VST3 plugin (while gui opened) (Renoise-V3.3.2/linux)
- TEST: for VST3 linux problems (bitwig refresh), checked in IPlugVST3
// #ifndef OS_LINUX CreateTimer(); // #endif
=> does not fix
- FIX: The vst3 GUI did not refresh, needed to move mouse over to animate
(Waveform11/linux/vst3) (BL_FIX_GUI_FREEZE)
=> This also fixes the following:
- FIX: All animated plugs: Bitwig3.3.1/vst3/linux: the gui stoped refreshing
after a while if we didn't move the mouse
- FIX: Waveform11/linux: fixed locale also for plugin
e.g BL-Chroma: the vertical axis (with note nams) was garbage
- FIX: - Waveform11/linux/vst3: freeze when resize GUI (vst3 only)
- FIX: fixed the prev fix
- FIX: Radium/linux/vst2: fixed GUI resize
- NOTE: VST2 GUI resize fails with Radium/linux
Test: try to ignore when no host resize is done => test
- FIX: Audacity/linux: time axis was not scrolling, for Chroma e.g
This is due to a current mistake in Audacity.
=> Workaround in BLUtilsPlug::GetTransportTime()
(and github issue made in Audacity project)
- TEST: The time axis labels does not align the same way depending on scroll speed.
(Audacity and Reaper linux)
Steps: play, change scroll speed without stopping play
=> the labels are not well aligned.
=> In fact, this is normal: in the spectrogram, we have some data with one speed,
mixed with some data with another speed => can not put the labels correctly because
the spectro data is not homogeneous.
=> To avoid this, restart playback after having changed speed.
- FIX: Audacity/linux: activate samplePos workaround depending on Audacity version
(because the fix is now merged in Audacity)
- FIX: avoid crash when OpenGL version is too low (Win10/Ableton10/IntelHD3000)
(OpenGL 1.1 was detected, instead of > 2)
- TEST: checked if we can auto remove dead code in VC2019 => no...
- NOTE: its seems ok to set the plugin id by hand, now that the form is down
=> the final guid will also use the mfr id (concatenated)
- FIX: now use iPlug2 text entrey instead of native ones, for text editting
(was used only on linux previously, but on windowsthat was necessary too,
because windowsnative text entry had problems, such as color and invisible caret)
- TEST: tested param groups (e.g VST3 Reaper/Bitwig) => this doesn't currently work.
- FIX: host UI, change gui size, plug UI => messy size
- FIX: reaper (linux) host UI, select small gui => this didn't activate
(it stayed to 0)
- FIX: Ableton, host UI, change GUI resize (theorical fix, not yet tested)
- TEST: re-checked all plugs parameters, when modified from host UI: ok!
- IMPROV: reorganized parameters logically in all plugs (for native host UI)
- NOTE: compile AAX on M1 chip: use new aax-sdk-2-4-0-beta,
instead of AAX_SDK_2p2p2 (also tested AAX_SDK_2p3p2: fail)
- NOTE: compiled libFLAC on M1 chip using cmake, and made a fat binary (3 archs)
- IMPROV: Mac3 M1: set configurable "hardened runtime"
- IMPROV: added "hungarian" to config files
- IMPROV: Mac3: installer Package.app
- IMPROV: recompiled and installed setfileicon
- IMPROV: made a dummy alias in zshrc for python 3.7
- IMPROV: update instally .py: modified the python exe path for M1
- IMPROV: AAX sdk, Mac M1 => set build system to "New" + "Legacy"
- FIX: Mac M1: there was a conflict / ios when building from command line (xcodebuild)
=> set the terminal to be launched by Rosetta => this fixed
- IMPROV: set certificated to Mac3 M1
- IMPROV: Mac M1: removed bad release note copy to plugin build
- IMPROV: Mac M1: added hungarian to sources (with group)
- IMPROV: Mac M1: added missing sources (PartialTracker6 etc.)
- NOTE: compiled everythiong on Mac M1
- FIX: Win10/VST3: resize gui => all knobs and widgets were set to zero 
(graphically only, iplug parameters stay good)
- FIX: Win10/VST3: change gui size from host ui => not applied, and button not reset
IPlug parameter was not modified (also on Linux VST3)
Also the case for any parameter (OnParamChange() was not applied)
- REFACT: GUIResizeParamChange(), adapted to fix VST3
- FIX: VST3: gui resize from host UI => prev parameter was not reset
- BUG: Reaper/Windows/VST3: automations were not applied to plugin
(knob move, but effect is not applied)
No problem with VST2 - Same problem on Linux/VST3
(Fixed correctly the prev fix: BL_FIX_VST3_PARAM_CHANGE)
- FIX: fixed a potential crash in popup menus
(change from Host UI, then from plug IU => sometimescrash)
- IMPROV: replaced the int parameters by enum parameters
(so in the host UI, this is more explanatory)
- IMPROV: updated all MacOS projects
(files added since Morpho, updated when recompiling BL-Sine for support)
- IMPROV: added all the project files to git for RebalanceStereo (+ Morpho)
and checked project setting "Legacy/New"


- BUG: Reaper/Linux/VST2: resize gui to portrait, then small,
then portrait from host UI => the value doesn't turn from 0 to 1
=> not repro on Reaper Windows VST2: this is a Reaper linux bug only


- TODO: check aax format (directories should be Contents/Win32|x64)
For the moment this is x86 and x86_64


- BUG: Mac 1 - Win10
       => Ableton 10, crash all plugins

- BUG: Mac 1 - Win7 - Ghost-X App (also Mac 2 Win10)
   Open Karma.flac, play => this crackles
   we must lower the out gain knob to stop crackles
   (same with Karma.wav)

- NOTE: Mac 1 - Win7 - Rebalance
   Windows warning "insufficient RAM, do you want to close th program ?"
   (Reaper + Rebalance take 200MB, this should be ok...)

- BUG: Mac1 - Win7 - Rebalance
  Sometimess the spectrogram turns black, and never returns
  (don't know how to reproduce...)

- BUG: Mac 1 - Win10 (USB Key 64) - Rebalance
  VST2 and VST3 crash just when inserting

- PROBLEM: if there is not enough space on disk (e.g 1GB only remaining),
the gui can become black. Tested on Mac1, Win10 USB Key. And also Rebalance crashes when initializing. => we must have 1 or 2x the size of the RAM free on disk.
