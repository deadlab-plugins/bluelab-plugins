v4.2
WIP…
- debug graph with distances smoothing

4.3
- tests, WIP
- debug graph with circles
- atan for azimuth

4.3.1
- WIP
- identity transform works ! (with distance and angle)

4.3.2
- clean
- tests
- => Got it !
- debug source viz
- code refactoring

4.3.3
- display: Got it !
- scanner mode in debug
- 2nd mode in debug: ok
- thanks to the use of float time delays

4.3.5
- the 3 display mode are well integrated

v5.0
- fixed several crashes in mono

v5.0.1
- double-click: reset knob value + edit knob text value 

v5.1.0
- FIX: center the points (because if they were big, they were not centered)
- GraphFader2 / TEST_FX_FADER => display “smoke/clouds/fire” instead of points

v5.2.0
- test vol render => good !
- TEST: see why the center is empty when we threshold => this is because radius is magn !
- DONE: colormap for frequencies
- IMPROV: second order equation for dist/azim => magns/phase
- FIX: fixed indentity transform for width = +0%

v5.2.1
- CLEAN: code cleanup
- TEST: implementation of HRTF
- FIX: fixed a crash with GraphFader2 (start playback, stop playback, re-start => crash)
- IMPROV: implemented volume display
- FIX: fixed “wobble” => implemented the simple method “mid-side”
- TEST: HRTF

5.2.2
- CLEAN: code clean
- optimizations
- increased the point size a little, so they are more visible without being too blurry
- IMPROV: the graph points were redrawn each time, even if not modified
=> new dirty flag (mMyDirty), so the graph elements re redrawn only if they have changed

- FIX: increased the coefficient for simple algo for compatibility (to get a similar width as previously)

v5.2.3
- port to pugl
- fixed a problem of background image which was incorrectly sized (why ?)
- restored flag for simple processing in StereoWidthProcessObj3 (otherwise it wobbled)
(The flag was accidentally set to 0, but this mistake was not in the 5.2.2 installer)
- IMPROV: optimized display (nvgQuad instead of nvgRect)

v5.2.4
- animated logo
- Fft15
- port to Fft16
- FIX: added code for fix latency (FftProcessObj16::computeLatency())
- TEST: tested perts and checked that was aleeady well optimized 
(stereoize uses oversampling 16 !)
- FIX: on Protools, when width was reset to 0, by using alt + click, 
the gain was increased compared to bypass
- TEST: tested GraphControl10/END_FRAME_NO_MUTEX => this improves the performances !
- FIX: Cubase 10, mac Sierra, VST3: click on the mono->stereo checkbox 
=> it freezed everything
- FIX: changed VST category: Sound field => Spatial
- FIX: fixed freeze Ableton 10 Windows 7 (gl context was not reset after drawing plugin)

v5.2.5
- recompile: FIX_CUBASE_STARTUP_CRASH
- recompile: benefit from FIX_RADIOBUTTON_CHECKBOX_BAD_REFRESH ?
- GHOST_OPTIM_GL
- OPTIM: do not compute ifft, no need (OPTIM_SKIP_IFFT)
- IMPROV: Use StereoWidthProcessDisp (display only)
- IMPROV: integrated new stereo widen and mono to stereo from Panogram
- OPTIM: use complex multiplication for computing stereo widening 
(STEREO_WIDEN_COMPLEX_OPTIM)
- NOTE: 30% optim after all (and more for mono to stereo)
- IMPROV: manage to have some display with mono signal and source and scanner modes
So we have at least a vertical line instead of nothing (StereoWidthProcessDisp, FIX_MONO)
- FIX: set PLUG_LATENCY to 0
- FIX: fixed abnormal latency
- TEST: tested latency with 88200Hz sample rate
- NOTE: with “midnight” test, the volume is a bit higher when width is set to maximum
(this looks normal, checked with the Panogram plugin to be sure)
- TEST: checked the stereo widen complex optimization: ok !
- NOTES (commercial): better sound, performances improved (30% less of CPU)
 
v5.3.0
- new version: “StereoWidth2”
	- new plugin id, new ilok sign key
	- correlation meter
	- width meter
	- 5 vectorscope modes
	- bass focus
	- pan
	- out gain
	- mono out
- IMPROV: created the GUI
- NOTE: not sure we optimize a lot with overlay display instead of the previous one
- FIX: Points display not showing in some cases
(FIX_GRAPH_RECREATE_WHITE_IMAGE_HACK)
- FIX: fine tuned circle drawer (FIX_CIRCLE_DRAWER_BOTTOM_LINE)

v5.3.1
- REFACT: big code clean
- FIX: fixed bass focus with pan => when bass focus at 0, we now can have mono signal,
that stays mono when extreme pan
- TEST: more optimization compared to just previous version: 15%
- IMPROV: aligned correlation meter and width meter centers
- DOC: new manual for “StereoWidth2”
- FIX: Keep the same plugin id, otherwise with Logic this will not be good when 
installing “version 2” over “version 1” 
(version 2 would overwrite version 1, and projects with version 1 won't work anymore)
- TEST: installed and launched version 1, install version 2 over, relaunch: ok !
(tested with Reaper VST, VST3, and Logic)
- FIX: fix Protools crash at plugin insert (FIX_PROTOOLS_CRASH_AT_INSERT)
- TEST: tested latency on Protools (and others) with new mono2stero with RTConvolver
- FIX: Upmix alt+drag did not work well on Protools (had to click, then press alt)
(FIX_PT_ALT_DRAG_UPMIX)
- FIX: FLStudio, Mac, AU, launch Impulses, choose Apply, play => crash
- TEST: checked bass focus code => it looks ok, for setting bass to mono !

v5.3.2
- New version just for recompilation

Next version: will benefit from RT_CONVOLVE_USE_WDL_FFT after recompilation

Changes not integrated:
- FIX: the bass focus knob / value were not well refreshed

v6.0.0
- IMPR0V: port to iPlug2
- NOTE: modifications done, it does not compile yet
- NOTE: now it compiles
- FIX: fixed circles display
- FIX: fixed vectorscope curves assignement (there were not correctly displayed)
- FIX: fixed upmix pan mouse drag
- FIX: fixed the size of the width knob
- REFACT: big code clean

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to linux
- FIX: fixed startup (missing resource in CMakeList)
- OPTIM: optimized memory: 1.5GB -> 20MB
- IMPROV: added the new design elements to the plugin
- IMPROV: changed circle graph drawer to choose the style from GUIHelper
- IMPROV: change the graph font to roboto bold (instead of simple roboto)
(did it hardly, globally for everything in graph)
- IMPROV: set style for all the evectorscope modes
- IMPROV: managed the spacing for vectorscope mode 0
- IMPROV: replaced buttons for vectoscope modes
- IMPROV: managed the spacings for all modes
- IMPROV: re-designed correlation meter and width meter
- FIX: fixed knobs aligment (now they exactly fit the background)
- FIX: fixed help button
- FIX: fixed exactly the bounds of the vectorscope data, so it doesn't go outside of the circle (and for lissajous and other mode so)

v6.1.1
- IMPROV: small design changes (after Mickael review)
  - renamed "pseudo stereo " -> "mono to stereo"
  - better knobs graduations
  - changed knob fill color
  - better checkbox colors
  - mono out aligment
  - title and values colors

v6.2.0
- REFACT: refactored vectorscope graphs
- IMPROV: added LockFree mechanism
- FIX: select upmix view mode, select another, re-select upmix => view not refreshed
- FIX: crash at startup (mode not initialized)
- IMPROV: moved back mono checkbox label
- IMPROV: removed the last view mode (the weird old stereo position)
- IMPROV: bass focus limit: a lot higher, to stereoize only air if we want
=> set to 6KHz, limit between "presence" and "brillance"
- FIX: fixed a crash when quitting
(since only 4 vectorscope modes)
- IMPROV: ctrl + click on vectorscope => reset
- IMPROV: created classes BLWidthAdjuster and BLCorrelationComputer2
- IMPROV: added class BLStereoWidener
(now it compiles)
- REFACT: cleaned code for new BL class for width adjust
- IMPROV: added with meter feature
- IMPROV: added width boost feature, with width limit adaptation
- TEST: passed valgring for memory (quickly): ok!
- REFACT: small refact
- TEST: passed valgrind for thread data race: looks ok!
- FIX: the display blinked (goes to black briefly)
That was because LockFree mechanism was not implemented at all for curve points
- FIX: click on an already active vectorscope button => the button was disabled
- IMPROV: now use bl_queue in CorrelationComputer2
(this fixed memory consumption)
- TEST: memory consumption: ok!
- TEST: lazy gui refresh: ok!
(it refreshes everytimes in the 3 first modes, but this is normal)
- FIX: when turning the width knob quickly, it crackleed
If bass focus is at 0Hz, it doesnt crackle (mayba)
With version without width limit, it doesn't crackles
=> added a width smoother to the new width limited processing
- OPTIM: optimized vectorscope (12/15% -> 12/14%)
- OPTIM: re-enabled quads "optim sampe color"
(that was disabled by mistake)
Very good optim: 12/14% -> 7/9%
- TEST: tested well mono->st, width limit, width boost with headphones
- TEST: checed perfs again to try to optimize more: nothing more to do!
- REFACT: switched to band splitter 4 (instead of 3) for bass focus
- FIX: vectorscope "number" buttons refresh was bad
=> now, set dirty all the 4 buttons in OnIdle() => seems to fix

v6.3.0
- IMPROV: integration of the new design
- IMPROV: disable (gray) width limit when width boost is enabled
- FIX: at startup no rollover button number was selected
- IMPROV: disabled BLWidthAdjuster::FIX_WIDTH_BOOST
(that made clicks?)
- FIX: rollover number buttons were blinking
=> fixed it once and for all by attaching buttons over graphs
(MANAGE_CONTROLS_OVER_GRAPH)
- FIX: passed valgrind and fixed mismatch new[]/delete
- TEST: passed valgrind for data race => looks ok
- OPTIM: LF mechanisme: avoid pushing many points or curves
We need only the last one! (OPTIM_LOCK_FREE)
Implemented in GraphCurve5: now we only have 0 or 1 command
(before we got around 100 commands (with bs=32)
- TEST: tested if we could benefit for the LF optim somewhere else: no!
- REFACT: removed old unused code
- OPTIM: with small block size (e.g 32), the vectorscope display consumed a lot
=> this was because the 4096 points were sent to display at each ProcesssBlock()
=> now it is independent of block size!
(OPTIM_SMALL_BLOCK_SIZE)
- PROBLEM: perfs drop down (moderately) with small buffer size
(and this is not due to vectorscope display anymore)
=> this is from mono->stereo, bacause WDL_ConvolutionEngine_DivAvail
computes many small Fft to provide samples frequencly
=> nothing to do against it...
- FIX: set block size to 2048 => crash
- NOTE: with big block size e.g 4096, the animation is not smooth anymore
- NOTE: for the click, this is Reaper that clicks, not StereoWidth!
Just launch Reaper with Thumb Piano, then play (no plug)
=> it often makes a big crackle after 1 second, then some crackles after 2s
(need to just launch Reaper, otherwise after some time, no crackles anymore) 
- NOTE: there is an error when passing hellgrind
(Bug in pthread / IPlug Timer)
=> impossible to fix, maybe this is not important...
- TEST: test GUI freeze linux with only 1 StereoWidth plugin => no freeze
- TEST: test GUI freeze linux with 2 StereoWidth plugin => no freeze
- TEST: test GUI freeze linux with 1 StereoWidth + 1 GhostViewer => no freeze
- TEST: test GUI freeze linux with 1 StereoWidth + 1 Ghost => it freezes!
- TEST: test GUI freeze linux with 2 Ghost plugins => it freezes!
- FIX: re-click on selected button number => it toggled off
- FIX: double click on a button => it toggled off
- IMPROV: added tooltips
- IMPROV: bass focus anti-click (from Air)
=> still some few clicks, but it is far better
- IMPROV: avoid automation on width meter and corr meter
- FIX: set bass focus to max => correlation is max, but width limter moves a lot
=> now, compute correlation on widen signal only (hi only, see bass focus)
=> so correlation meter and limited width meter are consistent
- FIX: stereo width meter behaviour changes with block size
=> now adapt width smooth time depending on block size
- TEST: passed valgrind => no problem
- FIX: when bass focus is disabled, correlation meter didn't move
- TEST: checked new bass focus smooth depending on block size: ok
- REFACT: indentation, comments etc.
- IMPROV: reduced a little jitter of correlation meter with small block size
- BUG: with bs=32 or bs=512, width limit triggers differently
- TEST: bounced stereo widened sound, and re-imported it
=> on this stereo width limit is independant from buffer size!
=> so the difference should be due to PseudoStereoObj !
- TEST: bounced pseudo stereo, w/o width limiter, and viewed only left channel
=> there are some subtle differences
- IMPROV: secure restarter: limt the fade size to 32 samples
This is sufficient, and avoid big fade for big block size
- FIX: the plugin is not transparent with block size 512 and small loop
(with block size 32, and bass focus off, it is transparent)
(fixed by previous)
- BUG(not a bug): with bs=32, width limit triggers differently
=> that was because the loop in reaper was not exactly on the clip, it goes
a bit later, and then the sudent stop of the sound made with limit to activate
(this was the case only with block size 512, not 32...)
=> finally there was in fact no problem with the width limiter behaviour, for block size 512 compared to block size 32 :)

v6.3.1
- IMPROV: port to windows

v6.3.2
- FIX: windows fixes

v6.3.3
- IMPROV: mac compilation
- FIX: pass in upmix mode, reduce the circle, try to drag => problems
The visible circle is not aligned to the draggable circle, very hard to catch it
=> now fixed the picking of the circle, this now works prefectly
- IMPROV: bass focus: now it leaves the low freqs untouched
instead of forcing them to mono
=> this is really more useful, and makes awesome result on nk-bells
(when widening only the high frequencies) (as suggested by a user by mail)
(BASS_FOCUS_FORCE_MONO)
- IMPROV: Design: "WIDTH LIMIT" -> "WIDTH LIMITER"
- DOC: updated the manual with the 2 prev improves
(bass focus and with limitER)
- IMPROV: added an option "Bass to mono", to force low freqs mono
Useful e.g when using mono->stereo, to really force bass to mono.
With this, we also keep also the current option "untouched under bass focus",
used e.g to stereoize air only.
- IMPROV: when "bass to mono" is off, pan everything
When "bass to mono" is on, pan only high freqs 
=> this avoids panning bass freqs when required (e.g when mono to stereo),
and make possible to pan everything if we are stereoizing air only.
- DOC: updated the manual
- IMPROV: fixed tooltip for bass focus

v6.3.4
- FIX: fixed windows compilation
- IMPROV: removed unused parameters that were displayd empty on host gui
- IMPROV: removed parameters for width meter and correlation meter
=> it looks ok
- IMPROV: renamed limit speed parameter

- NOTE: when increasing sample rate, the vectorscope display looks more "quick", less smooth (but this is not important for the moment) 


- IDEA: maybe add depth option (reverb, like in UST)

- PROBLEM: linux: upmix mode(and other modes)
=> keyboard shortcut for growing the circle is Alt
=> so we must click, then press Alt after
(otherwise the alt key will be used to mov the window)

- TODO: check the color of the upmix circle (design...)

- BUG: for mode 4, the circle top is a bit different (and we sould align the left and right labels with the other modes)

- BUG: dead lock between SetParameterValue/OnParamChange and ProcessBlock (lock graph)

- TODO: depth (+ drag and drop circle)
- TODO: add depth and brillance, and a checkbox = either depth, or force mono to stereo (or nothing)
- TODO: on Linux, use Cmd + draw instead of Alt+drag (alt + drag is used for moving windows by the system)

- TODO: for site images: make beaituful patterns using sine + precedence
(structured patters, vectorscope mode)
