v6.0.0
- IMPROV: port to iPlug2
- IMPROV: imported init() and mutexes from Ghost
- TEST: passed thread sanitizer: ok!
- IMPROV: benefit from awtk nanovg optimization + passed to 25fps

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to Linux
- IMPROV: linux compilation: put all the cmake libs in a function in a single file
- NOTE: now it compiles on linux!
- NOTE: we must create symbolic links under linux, to be able to compile with cmake with out of source plugins (plug out of iPlug2 dir). Link for each BL-Plugin set to iPlug2/Examples, and link of Libs in IPlug2/BL-Dependencies
- NOTE: need creating a symbolic link fakes Cmake root error (out of source...)
- IMPROV: re-enabled PARAMS_MUTEX in cmake files
- FIX: texts reversed on linux
- NOTE: re-enabling mutexes does not fix reaper crash when double-clicking on plug
- NOTE: the problem of window size at startup is also here with original iPlug2
- NOTE: tested an old version of the Linux branch: the problem of windows resize is already there.
- TEST: bug window size => tried valgrind => nothing detected
- TEST: bug window size: tried to remove timer => no success
- FIX: vst2, Linux: open in Reaper, display the plugin GUI,
close the plug window then re-open it => Reaper crashes
(BL_FIX_CRASH_REOPEN)
- FIX: with VST3, Linux, close the plug ui, re-open it => crash
And also when launching under gdb, it detecs an error when setting the timer
- NOTE: tested with Gain12, OnIdle() is not called if we define it
(BL_FIX_CRASH_REOPEN_VST3)
- FIX: On Linux, with App, sometimes the window is resized too small in height
(the bottom is cropped)
This is while adding the menu, we request to grow the height by 17 pixels
and if the window is already shown at this moment, sometimes the system
does not resize it (BL_FIX_LINUX_APP_WIN_SIZE)
- FIX: text entry is now white background, black text! (BL_FIX_HILIGHT_TEXT_ENTRY)
- IMPROV: Linux, added key events, in xcbt and IGraphicsLinux
(WIP. still needs to convert key codes and manage key modifiers)
- IMPROV: Linux, added keyboard handling in xcbt and IGraphicsLinux
- FIX: fixed text edit ctrl-a, ctrl-v etc.
- FIX: fixed text edit digits that were not accepted whent typing
- FIX: fixed text edit to accept comma for digit separator
- FIX: fixed arrow + shift that didn't return keysym
=> now text edit shift + arrow makes selection
- FIX: Linux - alt-click does nothing on my xubuntu system
=> so use ctrl-click instead
- FIX: Linux - fixed help button and manual display
- TEST: tested Linux vst2 with the latest improvements: ok!
- IMPROV: Added flag -Wno-write-strings to gcc
- TEST: Linux - tested sound of VST2: ok!
- REFACT: suppress (almost) all compilation warning in linux
- TEST: compiled in Release mode
- FIX: on Linux, open 2 Gain12, then close one => the other Gain12 window is freezed
- IMPROV: Linux - Optimized memory allocations (use and re-use temp buffers)
=> before: 10s, 360Mb allocated and deallocated. after: no additional memory allocations after some time.
- TEST: test memory with heaptrack => totally ok!
