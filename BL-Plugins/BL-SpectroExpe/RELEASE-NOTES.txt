v6.0.0
- from GhostViewer v6.0.2
- IMPROV: GhostViewerFftObj => SpectroExpeFftObj
- IMPROV: turned SpectroExpeFftObj from ProcessObj to MultichannelObj
- IMPROV: created the “mode” radio buttons
- IMPROV: implemented panogram mode
- TEST: tested that the panogram mode gave the same result as the panogram plugin: ok!
- IMPROV: made tests with freq panogram (good) and freq chroma (not interesting)
- IMPROV: added spectrogram_width (simple stereo widening computation) => very good
- IMPROV: added DUET magns and phases
- IMPROV: changed some scales to Db, to get better images
- TEST: tested a hack in ComputeStereoWidth() (take only .re), but it is not useful, it just resturns the standard spectrogram.
- TEST: found the best possible result
- IMPROV: benefit from awtk nanovg optimization + passed to 25fps
