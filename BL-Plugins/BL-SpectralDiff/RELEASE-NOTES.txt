27/01/2017 - v3.0
Initial version

v3.1
- profiling
- port to fft11
- half fft

- increased the overlap
- testing
- display the curves and bypass the plugin: the sound of the diff is not interesting
- added a bar for zero

- moved back to GLContext, w.o glow
- curve damping increased (better !) => reversed to less damp
- fixed reversed diff curve
- fixed diff curve that jumped up when no sound (clipped db to -120)

- added help button (and configured for managing manual)
- updated logo and installer icons

v3.2
- improved code (fix) for side chain stereo
- fixed problem with side chain, when nFrames was not 1024 (e.g in Reaper)

- fix for all the OpenGL plugs: 
=> made many big white rectangles in AbletonLive when destroying the plugin

v3.3
- Fft14: fixed some crashes with side chain (2 inputs, 1 sidechain)

v5.0
- if we have 1 side chain and stereo input, take only the left stereo channel for comparing

v5.0.1
- BUG FIX: fixed FFt14 for stereo sidechain

v5.0.2
- double-click: reset knob value + edit knob text value (but there are no knobs ;)

v5.0.3
- port to pugl
- FIX: Logic, High Sierra: crashed at startup when start playing

v5.0.4
- FIX: for high framerates, the frequency axis label values was not correct
e.g: 500Hz instead of 1KHz for 88200Hz
- FIX: fixed axis label: “200KHz” => 200Hz
- FIX: “50 Hz” => “50Hz”
- MODIF: changed buffer size from 1024 to 2048 and changed num curves points from 512 to 1024 (for good display of frequency labels…)
=> increased the precision !
- FIX: fixed low frequencies scale taxis that was not accurate at all (and false)

v5.0.5
- FIX: crashed auval when rescanned: freq axis compute got -1 index when samplerate 22050

v5.0.6
- animated logo
- FFt15
- graph with no border
- graph separator
- offset x vertical axis
- FIX: (From EQHack) side chain was not working on Orion (Windows) (fixed in IPlugVST2)
- Port to Fft16 + High res log curves
- FIX: fixed db scale for amplitudes 
(decimation made the high frequencies be lower than expected)
- FIX: crash StudioOne VST3 side chain (ANDI_FIX)
- FIX: fixed freeze Ableton 10 Windows 7 (gl context was not reset after drawing plugin)

v5.0.7
- recompile: FIX_CUBASE_STARTUP_CRASH
- recompile: benefit from FIX_RADIOBUTTON_CHECKBOX_BAD_REFRESH ?
- GHOST_OPTIM_GL
- Gui resize buttons
- REFACT: big refractor of all the resize gui code => set it in GUIHelper9 
(only for this plugin for the moment)
- FIX: fixed when vertical axis set on the left, if resize gui, the axis was offseted right (fixed the general case)
- IMPROV: added 3 guy resize buttons (as requested by Jon Amsler <jeamsler@gmail.com>)
- NOTE: on Logic, the GUI size buttons can freeze => to solve, remove the plugin
from the track and re-insert it

v6.0.0
- IMPROV: port to iPlug2
- NOTE: now it compiles!
- FIX: fixed diff curve (dB computation / display)
- FIX: fixed a thread sanitizer problem: after resizing, we wrongly kept the previous controls
- FIX: fixed resize gui bug, when resizing to big gui size, the graph were not displayed
well at all (because in fact, the plugin window was not resized to the required size)
=> used SetSizeConstraints()
- FIX: fixed amp axis (labels, ane lines alignment)
(changed GraphControl::GRAPH_CONTROL_FLIP_Y for vertical axis (horizontal lines)
- FIX: fixed x scale for curves (log factor -> mel)
- FIX: fixed SpectralDiffObj class (that was buggy with the new curves system)
(this class was done a very long tima ago, and was not more adapted as it is)

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to linux
- FIX: fixed the displayed values when sidechain is not connected
- OPTIM: memory optimization (gained 29MB)
- FIX: fixed compilation
- IMPROV: added lock free mechanism
- IMPROV: use better scale for freq axes and curves
- TEST: tested that we take mono in (and not only left channel): ok
- TEST: check that graph displays beautiful log lines for axis
and that freq axis scale is good): ok!
- NOTE: with new improvements from other plugs, this is really better
- REFACT: cleaned commented code
- NOTE: monitor button: no need!
=> now, we process anytime, not only when playing
- TEST: tested lazy gui refresh => it refreshes every time!
(but this is normal)
- TEST: passed valgrind: ok!
- TEST: testes mem consumption: this looks ok!
- TEST: tested perfs (nothing to optimize...): ok!
- NOTE: old bug (not repro): depending on the gui size, some vertical lines of the
graph axis were not displayed

v6.2.0
- IMPROV: integration of the new design
- IMPROV: added tooltips
- IMPROV: choose same style+color for side chain signal
(compared to othe plugins)
- IMPROV: applied curve smoothness improv from Air
- FIX: automatize gui resize params, click on gui resize buttons => problems
=> set the gui resize parameters flag to IParam::kFlagCannotAutomate,
so it is definitely fixed!
- OPTIM: with bs=32, this took too much additional resources
bs=32: 26% => 17%
- IMPROV: impelmented the App version, to compute spectral diff between 2 files
- IMPROV: improved app version, for outputing only the result
- IMPROV: app version: now compute diff in dB
- FIX: after changing sample rate, the curve value was not good anymore

v6.2.1
- IMPROV: port to windows

v6.2.2
- FIX: windows fixes

v6.2.3
- IMPROV: mac compilation

v6.2.4
- FIX: fixed windows compilation

- IDEA(?): make a scale on diff curve (to see the change better)
