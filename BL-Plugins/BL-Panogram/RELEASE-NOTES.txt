v5.0.6: initial version, from Chroma 5.0.6

v5.0.7
- renamed Pano -> Panogram
- first functioning: play spectrogram inside selection

v5.0.8
- big code clean (selection and play code was copied from Ghost)

v5.0.9
- use only one FftProcessObj instead of one for display, and one for replay
(so later we could transmit masks between PanogramFftObjs

v5.1.0
- REFACT: code clean (deleted the second FftProcessObj16)

v5.1.1
- IMPROV: play selection only in RECORD mode
- FIX: many fixes on synchronization of play bar, selection, freeze on/off
- IMPROV: limited play bar to selection box
- OPTIM: optimized HistMaskLine
- OPTIM: adaptations for GHOST_OPTIM_GL
- FIX: fix crash when selection is down half outside
- FIX: fix crash when selection is left half outside
- FIX: the play bar / bar scrolled slowly when on the right, and fast when on the left
- FIX: the play from the bar was not from the bar but always at the same start
(FIX_BAR_PLAY_BAR_SPEED)

v5.1.2
- FIX: re-activated USE_RESAMPLER (because the display is bad with sample rate > 44100)
- FIX: fixed bad display with high sample rates (and this, without resampling signal) 
(no USE_RESAMPLER, but FIX_BAD_DISPLAY_HIGH_SAMPLERATES !)
USE_RESAMPLER was bad for Panogram, because in Panogram, we need to play the sound
- IMPROV: align better the play bar / graph display, and the sound that is currently played (FIX_SHIFT_LINE_COUNT)
- IMPROV: avoid having the playbar playing at startup if we saved with freeze + play
(disable play even when check freeze on)
- FIX: with no selection, freeze on, freeze off, play 
=> the sound was played in the middle instead of on the right of the graph// IMPROV: play, - IMPROV: stop, play => the playbar now restarts at the beginning of the 
selection of the bar
- FIX: on Reaper, with Panogram, when clicking on "windows float selected FX", 
the colormap looked red (until we choose another colormap)
=> after ResetGL(), the colormap was not renewed

v5.1.3
-FIX: avoid selection outside the view (this made a silence, the time the play bar runned outside the view). => reduce the selection if it is outside the view (FIX_CLIP_SELECTION)
- FIX: just after having freezed, when clicking on the view, the spectrogram shifted lightly on the left (FIX_SPECTRO_SHIFT_CLICK)
- FIX: New method to align better the sound with selection and play bar (SHIFT_X_SELECTION)
- FIX: When left and right magns were 0, the indices are pushed at the extreme left
(FIX_EPS_MAGNS)
- FIX: play, freeze, wait a little, try to play a selection => no sound
This was because the data continues to arrive to the FftObj, and fills with zeros
This appended with in Reaper with TestSynchor project, where there are silences
(FIX_FREEZE_FFT_OBJ)
- FIX: With Reaper and SyncroTest (sine), Use a project freezed by default
=> de-freeze, play host, stop host, freeze, then try to play the panogram => no sound
The histo lines queue was not filled at the beginning (FIX_NO_SOUND_FIRST_DE_FREEZE) 

v5.1.4
- IMPROV: added stereo widen features (width, pan, mono to stereo)
- IMPROV: gray out stereo widen controls when freezes

v5.1.5
- IMPROV: added “GREEN” colormap
- IMPROV: moved the widgets and changed the GUI size
- FIX: fixed crackles with StereoWidth and Pan (added smoothers)
- IMPROV: set plugin io with 2 channels output
- FIX: with mono sound in input (with Logic), there was no sound as output
- TEST: rescan AU: ok
- TEST: sound transparency: OK
- IMPROV: avoid latency for nothing when we have no selection and we are just playing
- FIX: fixed latency compensation (due to mono to stereo), for any samplerate
- TEST: checked perfs: 24% CPU with full options (would be hard to optimize)
- FIX: when changed the sample rate after using previous SR, the state was wrong
(many masks were accumulated, all was out of synchro)
- FIX: clear the spectrogram if we change sample rate, and we already have data
(more coherent, avoids displaying the spectrogram while having cleared the audio data already)
- TEST: tests perts with small buffer sizes: with 64, the perfs are still acceptable
with 32, the CPU % doubles. => OK !
- TEST: test latency (with RX6 show channels separately): ok !
- FIX: on Windows, “L” and “R” letters were not displayed
- FIX: click freeze => the width button grays out, then change guy size 
=> the width button ungrays (same with pan and mono to stereo buttons)
- FIX: crash Cubase 10 Mac, crash at startup (null buffers) FIX_CUBASE_STARTUP_CRASH
- FIX: crash Cubase 10 VST3 only, when checking mono to stereo
(that was due to latency set from guy thread, not supported by VST3) 
(SET_LATENCY_IN_GUI_THREAD)

NEW:
- FIX: fixed two uninitiliaze values (NEW 20191006)
- FIX: on Mac VST2 (Cubase), window close seemed to be closed directly from another thread 
(FIX_MAC_CLOSE_BAD_THREAD)
- FIX: gray out knob text values when knob was grayed out
(the text is not becoming gray, but it is not editable anymore)
- FIX: fixes radiobuttons and checkbox refresh problem (the problem seemed to be before GHOST_OPTIM_GL) (FIX_RADIOBUTTON_CHECKBOX_BAD_REFRESH)
- TEST: use display link on max: USE_DISPLAY_LINK
(more smooth, but not finished, crashes and freeze sometimes, due to threads)
- FIX: when resizing GUI to the maximum, the logo was drawn 2 times, with a pixel shift
(it looked more thick). That may have been due to the previous background not well cleared
=> resized the background png to the maximum GUI size
- FIX: removed FIX_MAC_CLOSE_BAD_THREAD wihch made a bug
- FIX: really free the memory when the plugin is removed (FIX_GRAPHICS_COCOA_DEALLOC)

- BUG: Cubase 10, Sierra: random crash of Cubase when just opening the plugin
To reproduce, create and remove the plugin many times
=> the bug seems to have disappeared now

- FIX: Ableton, Mac, VST2 only: resize many times
=> it dead locks with the GraphControl10::DrawGL() mutex
(FIX_RESIZE_ABLETON_VST) => aborted

- FIX: (try 2) Ableton, Mac, VST2 only: resize many times
=> it dead locks with the GraphControl10::DrawGL() mutex
(FIX_RESIZE_GUI_ABLETON_DEADLOCK)

- FIX: If the plugin was hidden, and the host playing, mSpectroMagns and mSpectroPhases
 continued to grow, without being ever flushed (big memory leak)
(FIX_HIDE_PLUG_MEM_LEAK)

v5.1.6
- recompile with FIX_CUBASE_STARTUP_CRASH
- recompile: benefit from FIX_RADIOBUTTON_CHECKBOX_BAD_REFRESH ?
- FIX:in resource.h “#define FONT_ID 118 / #define KNOB_ATUNE_ID 118”
- IMPROV: updated mono2stereo from Lauridsen to PseudoStereoObj2 (no delay, no coloration)
- FIX: After a loop in the DAW, the left and right channels were sot synchronized anymore. PseudoStereoObj2 (FIX_LATENCY_RIGHT_CHANNEL)
- TEST: checked latency for mono2stereo for several buffer size and 88200Hz
- TEST: checked VST3 and checked that latency doesn’t crash
- DOC: update manual
- OPTIM: STEREO_WIDEN_COMPLEX_OPTIM
- TEST: tested latency on Protools (and others) with new mono2stero with RTConvolver
- FIX: FLStudio, Mac, AU, launch Impulses, choose Apply, play => crash

v5.1.7
- NOTHING REALLY NEW: disabled isPlaying(), to be able to use it while monitoring

Next version: will benefit from RT_CONVOLVE_USE_WDL_FFT after recompilation

v6.0.0
- IMPROV: port to iPlug2
- NOTE: WIP... (it doesnt compile yet)

- FIX: L/R was not displayed
- FIX: fixed time axis scroll (whatever the mode/monitor)
- FIX: fixed monitor for spectrogram and time axis
- FIX: monitor didn't play selection
- FIX: freeze, play, defreeze, freeze => the play button stayed toggled
- FIX: play, change GUI size while playing => the time axis scrolled very fast
- FIX: play button did't have y offset
- FIX: fixed correctly "play, stop, change GUI size
=> the time axis had an offset of around 2s"
- FIX: mon, then change gui size => the time axis stoped
- FIX: fixed freeze/play button when gui resize
- REFACT: removed duplicate code
- FIX: freeze, select, play than GUI resize => selection and play were reset
- REFACT: big code clean
- FIX: fixed a crash when wuitting

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to linux
- OPTIM: memory optim: 217MB -> 80MB (for default mode)
- OPTIM: memory optim for mono->stereo: 500MB -> 80MB 
- FIX: (after memory optim) select when playing => phases were really messy
- FIX: select, play, pause play => some sound continued indefinitely
=> managed all well, monitor, freeze, play

v6.1.1
- FIX: fixed compilation (BLTransport, spectro scroll4)
- FIX: fixed an uninitialized variable
- IMPROV: improved the accuracy of spectrogram play (sound)
(since spectro scroll 4?)
=> now it is much accruate (not 100% perfect, but really good!)
- BUG: play, click freeze while playing
=> spectro scroll jitters a bit statically
- IMPROV: disabled monitor when freeze is toggled on
- FIX: monitor, then freeze => this still scrolled
- FIX: activate mon, play, then check/uncheck freeze box => monitor button blinked
- FIX: monitor, bypass the plugin => it still scrolled
- REFACT: big code clean
- IMPROV: vertical scrolling for spectro scroll 4
- IMPROV: vertical orientation for graph drawer (center line)
- IMPROV: vertical orientation for time axis and L/R labels
- IMPROV: vertical orientation for selection (mouse move not yet done)
- IMPROV: vertical orientation for mouse making selection
- NOTE: vertical scrolling is now finished!
- FIX: monitor, bypass => black margin the the right
=> fixed by a hack
- FIX: play, put the transport somewhere very far (while playing)
=> the time axis scrolled very quickly, and weirdly
- TEST: tested memory consumption: ok!
- OPTIM: small perf optim (8/9% -> 7/9%)
- IMPROV: recompiled in double (since we output sound)
(it was compiled in float by default, by mistake)
- IMPROV: adapted gui refresh only when necessary (from Ghost and GhostViewer)
- FIX: draw selection => view was not refreshed
- FIX: freeze, play => view not refreshed

v6.2.0
- IMPROV: integration of the new design
- FIX: resize gui without playing => time axis drifted
- IMPROV: down arrow icon more readable
- IMPROV: added tooltips
- FIX: while playing , close UI, re-open UI => effect of bufferred scrolling
- FIX: fixed black border and buffered scrolling better
- FIX: fixed gui resize button alignment
- IMPROV: applied LF mechanism for spectro scroll (from Chroma, to avoid crash)
- FIX: activate monitor, automatize it => time axis frozen
- TEST: installed the latest Reaper version 6.32
- IMPROV: avoid a data race
- BUG: play, freeze, play button on, change block size => no sound
       - and play bar speed changes
       - the plugin behaves as pass thru
       - if we breifly activate monitor, it works after that
- FIX: fixed the previous bug
=> that was because playIn size was not updated (and then num samples requested
for FftProcessObj16 was not updated also)
- FIX: at 88200Hz, smooth scrolling jumped regularly (resynch)
- FIX: monitor + play, resize gui => time axis scroll a lot
(fixe from GhostViewer)
- FIX: play half at 88200Hz, freeze+play => sound when playing on empty region
- FIX: there remained some playable sound data after changing sampling rate

v6.2.1
- IMPROV: port to windows

v6.2.2
- FIX: windows fixes

v6.2.3
- IMPROV: mac compilation
- FIX: display was not centerd anymore, like if it was panned left a lot
That was a deep problem. When filterbank scale was linear, the data was just copied, whereas we should have took care of number of filters too, in case of resizing the data
=> modified Scale (filter bank)

v6.2.4
- FIX: fixed windows compilation
- IMPROV: changed the parameter name: "range" -> "brightness"

- PROBLEM: with sr>88200, sharpness smooth is not very good anymore

- PROBLEM: when no selection (and freeze), the sound doesn't start just at the
play bar, it starts a bit after.
And if we make a selection, it is played after it passes through the selection
(this is noticable)

- TODO: UpdateSelection(): do we need all these flags? (see also in Ghost)
