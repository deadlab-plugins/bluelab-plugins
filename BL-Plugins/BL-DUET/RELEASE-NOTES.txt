v5.0.0: initial version, from Bat 5.0.8
- REFACT: cleaned code from Bat
- IMPROV: implemented soft and hard elbow threshold
- IMPROV: added “mode” parameter for ImageDisplay
- IMPROV: added “extract” checkbox
- IMPROV: extract histogram max values
- FIX: fixed Window::MakeHanningKernel(), the kernel was false
=> Window::MakeHanningKernel2() No we have a good kernel !
- IMPROV: fixed when changing threshold, colormap => update everything well!
- IMPROV: implemented binary masks
- IMPROV: added a second threshold, and checkboxes for debugging
- IMPROV: implementation of PeakDetector2D (with “rubber algorithm”) WIP
- FIX: fixed mask color when displaying for debug: there was an invisible color for some mask values
- IMPROV: PeakDetector2D: avoid overlap of the detected peaks regions
- IMPROV: finished peak detection! this works great, with filled contours for peaks locations.
- IMPROV: PeakDetector2D: use fast incremental triangle fill instead of slow method
- IMPROV: implemented picking: pick on mask zones to select sound 
(picking cursor, cmd to cancel, alt to select background)
- IMPROV: implemented Weiner soft masking SoftMasking and SoftMaskingComp
(the implementation is a bit buggy)

v5.0.1
- IMPROV: fixed the formula of SoftMask and SoftMaskComp
- REFACT: cleaned code of SoftMask and SoftMaskComp
- IMPROV: added threshold width knob
- IMPROV: when alt is pressed, and we are picking a mask (pick succeed),
then select all masks at the same time to play the sound
- IMPROV: added knob for soft mask size
- IMPROV: fixed latency setup in resource.h
- IMPROV: implemented FillHistogram2(): more close to the DUET paper
(note: we keep samples out of bounds and put them in the border of the histogram)
- IMPROV: “threshold all “ option => play all the masks
- IMPROV: made masks with fade, so we fade progressively the regions

v5.0.2
- REFACT: code clean and refract

v5.0.3
- FIX/IMPROV: manage well masks/soft/alt key…
- IMPROV: make as int instead of double, when possible.

v5.0.4
- REFACT: cleaned commented code
- TEST: rechecked the sound of all options! (with headphones): ok!
- TEST: “happy in the eveningS”, the “S” disappeared => necessary to dimish peak threshold
- FIX: when nothing picked, the sound was mofidied => fixed!

v5.0.5
- IMPROV: now call Process() in the right thread after parameter changed 
(to update the view when not playing)
- IMPROV: when floor threshold is > 0, theshold globally and do not compute peaks
- IMPROV: system of mask smoothing when using only threshold
- IMPROV: added 2 knobs to manage the histogram zoom (alpha and delta)
- IMPROV: added 1 knob for histogram size (32 etc.)
- IMPROV: samples out of the histogram => take them well into account!
- FIX: - Wiener mask complex: fixed ! square = a * complex_conjugare(a)
=> the sound is better, and better than real wiener masks!
- ÒPTIM: optimized SoftMasking and SoftMaskingComp
=> 2% perf gain real, 7% perf gain for comp!
- TEST: benched perfs for DeNoise => nothing really necessary to optimize
=> the plug takes 15% CPU at the maximum, this is ok!
- IMPROV: implemented Phase Artifact Correction
=> works well for discarding bad peaks, but does not help for DeNoise and DeReverb
- TEST: histogram, DEFAULT_VALUE_ONE => bad!
- TEST: PROGRESSIVE_HISTORY (not tested deeply, finally de-activated)

v6.0.0
- IMPROV: port to iPlug2
- NOTE: ok, this launches and executes well
- REFACT: code clean
- IMPROV: imported init() and mutexes from Ghost
- FIX: fixed crash when resizing (number of gui size was bad)
- TEST: passed thread sanitizer: ok!
- IMPROV: benefit from awtk nanovg optimization + passed to 25fps

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to linux

v6.1.1
- IMPROV: port to windows
