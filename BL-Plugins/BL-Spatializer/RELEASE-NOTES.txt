01/07/2017 - v1.0
Initial version

v1.1
- improved parameters smoothing
- azimuth and elevation knobs react faster

v2.0
- interface 2.0

v2.5.1
- interface borders

v3.0
- new engine: the engine was totally reimplemented
(more strictly close to Kemar authors recommendations

v3.1
- started to implemente real width, based on phase difference computed
from the distance, the angles, and a "model" of the head
Not fully fonctionnal, buggy

v3.2
- uses new FftConvolver, more efficient and fixing aliasing
- implemented width, with efficient audible result 
(physically correct computation de-phasing due to source position and distance, 
but overstated effect of de-phasing to have better results)

v3.3
- correction of the crackles when changing the impulse response
-> smoother application of the movement of the knobs (but some latency)

v3.4
- use FftConvolverSmooth3 (instead of FftConvolverSmooth2)
- BUG fix: on Protools, with mono track, there was only left output
- BUG: fixed big crackles when nFrames was 512 (Reaper)

v3.5
- new interface
- improved the sensivity of the two head knobs
- head zone (WIP)

v3.6
- restructuring interface with head zone

v3.7
- improved the “graph” display

v3.8
- interpolation between the responses

v3.8.5
- smooth transitions (with the buf smoother)
- “faster and smoother parameters changes”
- gain from -12 to 12dB

v3.8.7: test with the diffuse data set (sounds worse)

v3.8.6
- hack to optimize convolver smoothing => 2x more reactive !
- fix on crackles when moving too fast the knobs, with maximum source width
(now the width is less audible but makes no crackles when changing azimuth)

v3.9
- profile
- fft11
- half fft

- GLContext2 => GLContext (new)
- GUI: heads dark blue
- FftConvolver6: set pad factor option as argument
- FftConvolver6: set normalise response fft as option

- stereToMono of the input

- fix graphic bug: buggy thin clear line around the heads
- fixed Reset() that was not called on restart (on Protools)
- fixed reset of param smoothers that were missing and bad

- added help button (and configured for managing manual)

- updated logo and installer icons

- changed plug unique id (for compat, for customers who bought the version 2)
(and reverted it, to avoid loosing automations when changing version…)

v4.0
- changed the image of the heads (and adapted the dot knobs + reversed the direction of azimuth)

v5.0
- fixed a crash in mono

v5.0.1
- BUG FIX: after reset, azimuth was reversed in the smoother

v5.0.2
- double-click: reset knob value + edit knob text value

v5.0.3
- FIX: FftConvolver6: fixed crackles when host buffer was small (447)

v5.0.4
- FIX: param smoother not updating when the sound is is playing zeros
=> improved source move when the sound contains silences
- FIX (after pref fix): choose left ear, play before a silent zone, 
cross the silent zone ane leave without touching the knob: 
when the sound restarts, the impulse response was false
- tried to fix => that made clicks on Reaper with nFrames==447
=> Finally, suppressed the IsAllZero() test

v5.0.5
- animated logo
- fixed crash in Logic when changing Azimuth automation by hand (utf8 coding of “°”)
- FIX: fixed latency changes with buffer size (e.g with host buffer size 447 v.s 1024)
- IMPROV: resample the impulse responses depending on the project sample rate
- FIX: (due to prev changes): avoid crackles with width=100%, sr=88200, turn azimuth knob when playing
- FIX: change Azimuth to -100, play, Alt + click Azimuth knob
=> the sound was not updated to 0 degrees until we re-touch the Azimuth knob
- FIX: width=100%, block size exactly 1024, sr=44100 => this crackled (FftConvolver)
- TEST: FftProcessObj15 + convolution (+ fix bract badly closed)
- Manage well latency when block size > buffer size (change in FftConvolver6)
- improved smooth crackles problem when moving the knob quickly
(Modified BufProcessObjSmooth2, FADE_START and FADE_END)
- FIX: when playing after a reset, the first move of the kbon makes a click
(hack to fix in BufProcessObjSmooth2)

v5.0.6 (forgot to note it)

v5.0.7
- FIX: fixed clicks with block size 64, when moving azimuth very fast
(use FixedBufferObj)
- IMPROV: do not smooth azimuth and elevation anymore 
(no need anymore because we have the smooth convolved)
=> so the parameter will be more reactive
(make very small additional rumbles at 192KHz)

v5.0.8
- REFACT: big code clean (in ProcessDoubleReplacing and more)
- FIX: when playing a short loop in Reaper, and moving azimuth quickly 
(by hand, not by automation), there was clicks and buffers residual signal.
Only appeared when playing the project by hand (not when bouncing) 
=> Solution: FORCE_IMPULSE_UPDATE2: update BufProcessObjSmooth2 every time

- FIX: Reason, click when starting playback
=> modified FftConvolver6, to avoid making fft of data which is all zero
=> modified FixedBufferObj, ResizeOutput did not initialize the buffers to 0
FIX: Crashes Studio One 4, Sierra, AU (but not VST)
=> was due to the degree symbol
- FIX: Logic 10.4 and Protools 2018 (Sierra): when stop playing, there is a remaining 
sound (a sort of noisy ghost of the previously played sound)

v5.0.9
- recompile: FIX_CUBASE_STARTUP_CRASH
- recompile: benefit from FIX_RADIOBUTTON_CHECKBOX_BAD_REFRESH ?
- FIX: fixed regression Spatializer5.0.8 => Spatialize 5.0.9 (clicks)
(Utils::Fade(), FIX_REGRESSION_SPATIALIZER)

Next version: will benefit from RT_CONVOLVE_USE_WDL_FFT after recompilation

v6.0.0
- IMPROV: port to iPlug2
- NOTE: it doesn't compile yet...
- NOTE: now it compiles
- FIX: fixed some GUI problems
- FIX: fixed the sound (now it is ok)

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to linux
- FIX: fixed crash at startup (hrtf was not copied in target "resources")
- REFACT: renamed LoadMac() to LoadMacLinux()
- OPTIM: optimized memory (1GB -> 150MB)

v6.2.0
- FIX: fixes for recompilation
- REFACT: renamed gain -> out gain
- REFACT: used BLUtilsPlug::ApplyGain
- IMPROV: big -> small knobs + moved the knobs 
- IMPROV: bacis XYPad working!
- IMPROV: X/Y pad: ensured the handle will never goe outside the track
- IMPROV: X/Y pad: manage the border (stroke width) of the track
=> so now, the handle stays exactly in bounds and is not drawn over track border
- IMPROV: X/Y pad: ctrl + click => reset
- IMPROV: X/Y pad: when clicking on the circle, do not make it jump!
when clicking outside circle: make it jump
- IMPROV: XY/Pad: reversed y direction compared to head elevation
(using a flag, it will depend on the plugins)
=> now, elevation gets higher when xypad y get higher
- IMPROV: X/Y pad: manage shift key for fine manipulation
- TEST: passed valgrind: ok!
- TEST: checked mem consumption: ok!
- TEST: checked lazy gui refresh: ok!
- TEST: tested perfs: 7%, this is ok
(if need to optimize, use FastRTConvolver instead of standard convolver)
- IMPROV: implemented spatializer handle (vector)
- IMPROV: more fat spatializer handle
- TEST: check well smoothing azimuth/elev after ParamSmoother2: ok!

v6.3.0
- IMPROV: integration of the new design
- IMPROV: added tooltips
- FIX: automate elevation (trim/read), move elevation => XY pad X did not reset
=> this was because automation/apply value to control managed only the 1st param

v6.3.1
- IMPROV: port to windows
- FIX: win: now correctly load hrtf
(load it even if we have no GUI, and adapted resources to iPlug2)
- REFACT: removed iGraphics unused param for hrtf load
- FIX: win: fixed the mechanism of config.h header
- TEST: tested win VST3 x64: ok!
- FIX: fixed win vst2 x32, with GUI: ok!
There was a problem of manual resources
- IMPROV: added security in case of the manual was not found
(just in case, would avoid problems of freezing plug GUI)
- FIX: removed MANUAL_FN from all main.rc files
=> otherwise with 32 bit compilation, it says "file not found"
=> and also wrote: "MANUAL_FN PDF MANUAL_FULLPATH_FN" in rc

v6.3.2
- FIX: windows fixes

v6.3.3
- IMPROV: mac compilation

v6.3.4
- FIX: fixed windows compilation
- FIX: Ableton11/win: XY pad was buggy (only 1 direction) (only in release)
- FIX: drag and drop xypad => crash (only in release)
=> this was because of td::initializer_list() syntax on windows

- TODO(?): X/Y pad: legend

- TODO: check if we still need all the smoothers with new (WDL) rt convolver
(smooting adds a bad lag)
