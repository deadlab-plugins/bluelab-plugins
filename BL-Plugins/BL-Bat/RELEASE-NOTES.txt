v5.0.0: initial version, from Panogram 5.1.5
- REFACT: cleaned code from panorama
=> this version is a simple panogram

v5.0.1
- first tests: use atan2(l, r)

v5.0.2
- implementation of paper “Localization of multiple sound sources with two microphones” -
Chen Liu (implementation of the basic principle)
(preparing g a clean project version)

v5.0.3
- begin of implementation of paper
- implemented correctly the paper basis (delay line replaced by fft phase shift)
- cutoff at 6KHz
- NOTE: no stencil implementation for the moment

v5.0.4
- tests for 2D (SourceLocalisationSystem2D => give up)
- hack: for 2D, use 1 line on x and 1 line on y, then multiply
=> we get a cool heat map !
- implemented stencil (deactivated for the moment)
- better detection: no more constant sound source at the center
(ALGO_LIU disabled, new ALGO_NIKO enabled)

v5.0.5
- optimizations
- Optimized phase shift : simply multi complex instead of many sin, cos and aran
(OPTIM_PHASE_SHIFT_COMPLEX) => very big perf gain !
- optimized: avoid allocating big data each time (OPTIM_DELAYED_SAMPLES)
- optimized one allocation “in loop” (OPTIM_RESULT_DIFF)
- optim: OPTIM_COINCIDENCE_PUSH
- conclusion: OPTIM_PHASE_SHIFT_COMPLEX mades a lot of optimization, the others not sure..
- tests with 2d modes: MODE_2D3

v5.0.6
- IMPROV: better 2d implementation
- TESTS: tests to try to get good results in 2D => INTER_MIC_DISTANCE is very important !
DEBUG_2D
- FIX: fix/hack stencil mask to have exactly the good number of lines compared to 
the coincidence mask (STENCIL_HACK)

v5.0.7
- IMPROV: fine tune stencil (dilation, precomputed masks…)

v5.0.8
- REFACT: code clean
- TEST: tested mask orientation: ok !
- TEST: implemented different methods for stencil
- FIX: fixed TimeIntegrate(), which had no effect
- TEST: test BuildMinMaxMap()
- TEST: implemented MaskMinMax() => make larger bells
- DEBUG: display the coincidence map in real time on the graph
- TEST: tested with a mixed track => interesting results
- DEBUG: display the localization curve in real time on the graph
- TEST: Calmes works better with Sine MultiSources than Niko
- TEST: Niko works better with WhiteNoise MultiSources than Calmes
- IMPROV: implemented FreqIntegrateStencilCalmes2()
=> now Calmes well implemented, works with multi sine and multi noise tests
(for multi sine, we must move the freq knob for a good calculation)
- TEST: at 30cm (mac, RealTime) => 1 or 2 samples of difference…
- TEST: white noise, fake delay => max +/- 54 samples (good significant move: 20 samples)
- NOTE: 1 sample = 7mm @44100Hz
- IMPROV: implementation for 2 vertical Zoom H1 (left and right)
=> coincident mics => manage amplitudes

v6.0.0
- IMPROV: port to iPlug2
- FIX: fixes to make Bat work => ok!
- REFACT: big code clean
- IMPROV: replaced GraphCustomDrawer::AlwaysRefresh() by NeedRedraw()
- IMPROV: adapted init and mutexes from Ghost
- TEST: passed thread sanitizer => nothing to fix! all ok!
- IMPROV: benefit from awtk nanovg optimization + passed to 25fps

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to linux

v6.1.1
- IMPROV: port to windows

- IDEA: try to get the same visu as in the movie “The Seed” (electromagnetic field displayed in blue/grey). Use the panogram algorithm on X and on Y, and interpolate. Put the two zoom stereo recorders in cross (to get a “double-cross”).
