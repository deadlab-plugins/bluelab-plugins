v5.0.0
- IMPL: from Air-v5.3.5
- IMPL: created the plugin
- IMPROV: creating the mix button and mix between reverb and dry signal
- IMPROV: reverb increase with the mix button
- IMPROV: set exactly the same parameters as DUET
- TEST: it makes exactly the same effect as DUET
- TEST: histogram, DEFAULT_VALUE_ONE => bad!
- TEST: PROGRESSIVE_HISTORY (not tested deeply, finally de-activated)
- TEST: when the sound starts, the beginning of the sound goes to the reverb part
Project: BlueLab-StereoDeReverb-TestReaper-VST2-DeReverb.RPP
=> not a bug ! The beginning of the sound is real reverb!
- FIX: changed “plug channel io” in resource.h, to manage only stereo
- TEST: passed auto tests => ok!
There is sometimes isolated formants at the early beginning of the bounce. 
But this is due to the Reaper autotest: we bounce while we are still playing (in loop)
then reset is not called, and it draws some additional formants. This shouldn’t be a problem for normal use.
- TEST: checked with other sample rates
- TEST: tested with 2 sounds sources + reverb => ok !
- DOC: written the manual

v5.0.1
- IMPROV: try to remove gating effect: SoftMaskComp3 + middle data
(PROCESS_MASK_CENTERED)
- IMPROV: StereoDeReverbProcess: SOFT_MASK_SIZE 8 => 16
(otherwise, SoftMaskComp3 + middle data made more musical noise than before)
- NOTE: conclusion: with this modifications, the gating effect is diminished a little,
the voice sounds a bit closer to us, less “far in the middle of a room)
And the masking has better quality, less feeling of musical noise.
- TEST: used valgrind to check for memory corruption (play, and remove the plugin) => ok!

v6.0.0
- IMPROV: port to iPlug2
- NOTE: now it compiles and executes well!

v6.1.0
- IMPROV: port to linux
- OPTIM: memory optimization (2GB -> 20MB)

v6.1.1
- IMPROV: port to windows
