- IMPROV: improved panel switching => now it is ok, and perfs also
Take into account all the controls, not only the main ones.
Avoid processing when rollover on the 2 panel buttons
- REFACT: big code clean
- TEST: checked that OnUIClose() is well called juste before destroying the plugin
(for Panel memory release): ok!
- IMPROV: defined all parameters
- IMPROV: adjusted menus size and pos
- IMPROV: refreshed all parameters when changing pannel, so the controls gets updated

- FIX: fixed refresh problem XYPad
- IMPROV: manage parameters of SySources
- IMPROV: create SySource when creating SoSource
- IMPROV: remove correctly SySource when tab is closed
- FIX: new handles did not appear when creating a new tab
- FIX: fixed crashes when changing mode if we had some sources created
- IMPROV: 3 state handles (normal, hilight, grayedout)
- IMPROV: manage better handle hilighting (using sources)
- IMPROV: change tab will hilight other handle
- IMPROV: hilight other handle when changing tab (if not already)
- IMPROV: gray out handle when source muted
- FIX: when source mute, then change source, GUI gray out did not toggle off
- IMPROV: source0 (mix): now managed like another source (parameters etc.)
- FIX: mix source: now grays out unused knobs/controls
- FIX: create a new tab, switch to synth => controls were grayed like if mix type
- IMPROV: avoid unchecking "master" toggle button
- FIX: "master" option was not transmitted between tabs
- IMPROV: disable "master" when enabling "master" to another source
- NOTE: master checkbox now well synchronized!
- IMPROV: check master flag on the first real source created
- IMPROV: transmit the master flag when source destroyed
- IMPROV: gray out the whole source section when there is not source
- IMPROV: handle for Mix source -> different image! (mic style icon)
- FIX: small jumps when handling sources (not "mix" source)
=> this was because now handle0 has a size different from the other handles
- IMPROV: reverse display order => so the "mix" handle is under sources
(and also reversed picking order, to stay consistent)
- IMPROV: label on Sy side, display icon and source name
- IMPROV: basic open file => tab name, source name
- FIX: font was nor the same in tabs and in icon label
- FIX: icon label: now use short file name
- FIX: tabs did not refresh after open file
- FIX: handles was not here after open file
- FIX: create a source, go to Sy, mute it, drag it => synth type menu re-enabled
- NOTE: Now basic buttons GUI reacts well. Now needs to add spectro and waterfall

v6.0.1
- REFACT: source "Generic" -> source "Impl"
- REFACT: refactored the whole So source side
- REFACT: refactored the whole Sy source side
- NOTE: now all is well refactored
- IMPROV: created new classes: GhostTrack2, and associated custom drawer and control
- FIX: now it compiles with GhostTrack2
- REFACT: removed dependencies between GhostTrack2 and Ghost plugin
- IMPROV: created a GhostTrack2 
- REFACT: create GhostTrack2 better
- IMPROV: GhostTrack2 integrated! (it compiles, now need to test)
- IMPROV: now we see the spectrograms!
- IMPROV: changed the spectrogram colormap
- FIX: spectrogram was enlarged in height
- FIX: when zooming, the view was not refined
- FIX: spectrogram did not disappear when changing view
- FIX: create spectro, change pannel an return => graph state was very messy
- FIX: fixed SoSources that were never deleted
(now can create several sources, suppress some => this works!)
- IMPROV: now transmit brightness, contrast etc. to spectro
- FIX: spectro zoom center was not good when mouse over
- IMPROV: now draw border around spectro graph
- IMPROV: even draw graph borders when there is no graph
For this, draw the graph background bitmap, whis has white borders
- FIX: fixed valgrind unitialized values
- FIX: fixed crash when quitting
- FIX: fixed crash when suppressing a SoLive source
(GhostTrack fix: FIX_REMOVE_CONTROL_MORPHO)
- FIX: when zooming, the view refinement was bad (and also live problems)
- FIX: fixed a crash when quitting
- FIX: when changing panel, SoSource whole graph were not re-created
- FIX: open so file source, spectrogram disappeared if close/reopen UI
- FIX: so live source, spectrogram disappeared if close/reopen UI
=> fixed a big bug: colormap data was reset is close/open ui
- FIX: fixed crash when closing/reopening UI
The problem was that the custom drawer and so on were not deleted before closing
the UI, but just at the moment of re-opening, when we had no OpenGL context anymore
- FIX: open 2 live sources, play the first, close/openUI => spectro was black
(need to select the other tab, then the current one, to retrive the spectro)
=> that was because all So graphs were disabled after controls re-creation
- FIX: play button is now well associated with sources/params
- IMPROV: manage the So sound well (mute when not playing etc.)

v6.0.2
- IMPROV: created all the waterfall and rt SAS classes (does not compile yet)
- IMPROV: now it compiles
- FIX: now it starts to show waterfall
- FIX: waterfall problem when changing panel
- FIX: crash when quitting
- FIX: when playing a spectrogram, the result sound was the live one
- FIX: the spectro selection dir was not taken into account
- IMPROV: linked waterfall angles to plugin params
- IMPROV: waterfall angles now global to all sources 
(when changing one source waterfall, all angles of the other sources are updated)
- FIX: now waterfall angles are well re-applied when re-starting the host
- REFACT: suppress unused (and very dirty code), for waterfall angles
- IMPROV: set good default waterfall angles (not aligned)
- FIX: when changing panel, the waterfall data was reset (flat grid)
- FIX: fixed detection parameters
- IMPROV: fixed waterfall grid density (take max density, like in SASViewer)
- FIX: fixed color coeff that was not initialized (and other coeffs)
=> the color looked buggy)
- FIX: fixed a crash when playing (waterfall thread error)
- IMPROV: tracking lines: choosen better color theme (blue/green)
And also better color for detection points
- IMPROV: set default freq threshold to 25% (instead of 50%)
- FIX: sometimes interaction froze forever, after opening tooltip
e.g with ICaptionControl associated with drop down menu
=> this was because many tooltips were created undefinitely, resulting on slow down
and interaction freeze. (a new tooltip could have been created whereas we already had
a tooltip opened)
- IMPROV: in waterfall view, also display "input"
- IMPROV: in waterfall view, also display harmonic (like noise)
(and sort well: input, detection, tracking, harmonic, noise, color, warping)
- IMPROV: set bevel for LinesRender2
=> more beautiful, will avoid some artifacts
- IMPROV: found a good lines render scale for displaying mangns and related
- IMPROV: color waterfall had a strange scale
- TEST: waterfall harmonic should have bigger peaks
Tested the real data view => this looks drafty, not good.
- IMPROV: added on waterfall view the 3 sub window for pitch etc (need to compile)
- FIX: fixed compilation (for CurveView s)
- FIX: CurveViews: now borders and titles are well displayed
- FIX: now the amplitude CurveView is working!
- IMPROV: made a dark transparent background for CurveView s
- IMPROV: pitch and partials CurveView s start to display something
- IMPROV: pitch CurveView is now working
- FIX: partials curve view is now ok
- NOTE: all curve views are finished!
- TEST: compiled in release => seems fast
- REFACT: moved IIconlabeControl from Morpho to bluelab-lib
- IMPROV: choose curve view num data to have same speed than in waterfall view
- IMPROV: slow down the waterfall and curve views scrolling: very good!
=> it is far more readable
=> it takes 10% less resources (in release)
- FIX: so file source: spectrogram play bar does not show at startup
(when selection is full, must click once on the spectrogram to make it appear)
- IMPROV: pitch curve view: make the curve "jump" correctly when required
(AVOID_TRACING_PITCH_JUMPS)
- FIX: there was some original sound that is output (stereo channels)
- IMPROV: manage source type "bypass" option
- IMPROV: apply the source gain knob on So side
(effect on CurveViewAmp, and on output volume)
- IMPROV: trigger the play button with the space bar
- REFACT: refactored so angle listener call chain transmission
=> transmit listener top down instead of transmitting the message bottom up
=> now avoids making all the chain classes inheric from view 3d listener
- REFACT: removed all PartialTracker8 and QIFFT references from MorphoWaterfallView
- TEST: tried the idea for pitch detection (chromagram, but on harmonics only)
=> this doesn't seem to change the result drastically... (tested on edge trimer sound)
- NOTE: So section is finished!

v6.0.3
- REFACT: renamed MorphoRTPipeline MorphoSoPipeline
- REFACT: extracted MorphoWaterfallGUI from MorphoSoPipeline
- REFACT: remove indirections to MorphoWaterfallGUI in MorphoSoPipeline
=> now this is very well separated (sound processing/GUI)
- REFACT: renamed "input" waterfall mode to "amp"
(so it will be used for result output too)
- IMPROV: add Sy graph background by default when no source
- REFACT: removed old commented code
- REFACT: SoSource and SySource inherit from WaterfallSource
=> so SySources will manage Waterfall view automatically!
- IMPROV: manage Sy sources view (and some other params)
- IMPROV: created ViewTitle class
- IMPROV: integrated correctly ViewTitle: ok!
(it changes in Sy mode, when turning knobs!)
- FIX: Sy view mode also changed when toggling solo off
- IMPROV: created MorphoSyPipeline (+ some glue)
- IMPROV: created MorphoSASMixer (empty for now)
- IMPROV: continued on Sy section
- IMPROV: IXYPadControl: now possible to retrive handles positions
- IMPROV: transmit handle positions to SySources
- REFACT: better implementation of handle coords and pad ratio
- IMPROV: implemented almost all the Sy part! (need to test)
- FIX: fixed crashes
- FIX: fixed more crashes
- FIX: passed valgrind and fixed mistake
- FIX: fixed a crash due to partials linkedId
(must re-sort after having mixed sources, because frames can be not consecutive etc.)
- FIX: Sy panel: sometimes the view displays "tracking"
- REFACT: removed old commented code
- FIX: select sy mix source => amp display was very buggy
(this was because we got XYPad values in %)
- FIX: fixed pitch units
- FIX: fixed params factors scale (pitch etc)
- IMPROV: implemented correctly SAS factor (frame -> synth)
- FIX: mix sas params were not applied to sound
- FIX: mix waterfall view didn't change when chainging mix params
- FIX: sas params were not applied to waterfall view
- FIX: out gain was not applied anymore
- FIX: noise envelope was flat in sy source waterfall view
(and also in sy mix view)
- FIX: noise mix is now noise/harmo mix (when at 100%, we have no harmo)
- IMPROV: when turning the noise scale > 0, apply a noise scale of 2
=> so we can increase the noise more than the origin
- FIX: fixed SetSkipFft() that prevented call to ProcessFftBuffer()
- FIX: several fixes => not sy can output sound!
- FIX: mix waterfall scrolled 2x faster than source waterfall
- FIX: made work ping pong
- FIX: toggle reverse: play position jumped
- FIX: pitch didn't work on sy file sources
- IMPROV: now time stretch works
- IMPROV: merge partials (2 raw sources) for mixing => starts to have sound
- FIX: mix 2 raw sources: fixed partials continuity (sounded bad)
- IMPROV: manage the "loop" flag better
- FIX: gain of the first soure to 0 => both sources were silent
NOTE: this fix may affect the mix of the noise part
- IMPROV: keep sy file source handle grayed if "apply" has not been done
- FIX: fixed valgrind "uninitialized value"
- FIX: fixed another valgrind "uninitialized value"
- FIX: pitch curve went 1 pixel before and 1 pixel after in width
- FIX: the first curve pitch segment was wrong
- FIX: pitch sometimes went outside the curve view
- IMPROV: use synth mode "source" instead of raw
=> so we can now apply color and warping!
- IMPROV: transmit synth mode (SAS or "source") from so so synthesis
(quick solution for the moment, to be improved)
- FIX: when color was at the minimum, the sound stoped (and the host muted)
- FIX: now the noise envelope outputs some sound!
- IMPROV: grayed out sy "synth type"/all partials etc. if source is "monophonic" 
- IMPROV: grayed out apply button for live sources
- IMPROV: gray out file source apply button until threshold changes
- IMPROV: grayed out "reverse" and "ping pong" for live sources
- REFACT: refactored the gray out system which was confusing
- REFACT: removed commented code + more refact
- FIX: sy live source, mute, unmute => "loop" got enabled
- IMPROV: some improvements for mixing several sources
Fixed source distance value, handle param change, and distance factor apply to frames

v6.0.4
- IMPROV: adjusted the SAS synth scale, so the SAS level is not too high
(SYNTH_AMP_COEFF_RESYNTH)
- IMPROV: adjusted the mixing of the sounds (forgotten to previously commit)
- TESTS: tested pitch jumps with a simple sine (hardly cut in some region)
=> Monophonic source -> this makes big sound artifacts (pitch shift)
=> Complex source => some artifacts, but not too hard
- FIX: color effect was inverted
- FIX: finished previous fix
- FIX: color envelope behaved really wierdly with some params
- IMPROV: manage "complex" sources better => starting to be good
Seems good for factor + addition, to mix frame correctly
- IMPROV: when selecting e.g "color" for a source, pass all the sources in same mode
- FIX: pitch was not applied source by source (only mix)
- FIX: amp not applied source by source (only mix)
- FIX: color was not applied source by source (only mix)
- IMPROV: source color etc. mute and solo: more or less ok
(set INTERPOLATE_PITCH to 0)
- REFACT: code clean after prev commit
- REFACT: replaced "SAS" by "Morpho" everywhere
- FIX: now when mix source is muted -> no sound

- TODO: audio clicks
- TODO: checkbox for pitch
- TODO: implement midi

- TODO(?): optimize a lot
- BUG: sources distances, something wierd
(y reversed? / weird with 3 sources

- TODO(?): gray out solo mute for mix source
=> see what is the use of mix color etc. solo/mute
(different effect than other sources?)
(disable them or not?)

- PROBLEM: audio click when loop restarts 

- TODO(maybe): avoid many duplicate in mixer 

- TODO: Midi messages / virtual keyboard
 
- BUG: source is solo by default

- PROBLEM: distance, when mic is far above all sources

- IDEA :) add a delay? :)

- TODO: check linkedIds for SASPArtials (they are not linked?)
- BUG: computation of weights/distances seem false
- PROBLEM: SAS synth interpolation of frequency seem wrong
- BUG: volume of SAS synth is very high compared to "source" synth
- TODO: disable possibility of master flag for live sources
(gray out controls etc.)
- TODO: manage solo/mute
- TODO: manage solor/mute for color, warping etc.
- TODO: manage selection in SyFileSource


- BUG(?): when outputing the noise envelop only, it sounds like phase issues
- BUG: when in SAS resynth mode, the sound is very high (particularly on transients)

- BUG: if set Reaper block size different from 512, sy play is stretched
(e.g set it to 32 => it plays very quickly)

- NOTE: SASFrame7::AddFrames, skipped add raw partials and add norm partials

- TODO: SASFrame7::AddFrame: must add raw partials
(and adapt the ids and linked ids accordingly

- BUG: pitch source to 2, mix to -2 => we don't get result pitch at 0
- TODO(later): improve noise scale effect
Turn noise to 100% on source, and on -100% on mix => sould be 0 (it is > 0)
Turn noise to 100 on source, and on 100% on mix => shoud be 200% (it is 100%)

- TODO: SySources, amp => should process the sample result and get back the fft
=> "output magns" => output result waterfall
- TODO: must manage click on knobs, to change mode

- BUG: startup, select sy mix source => we are in noise mode instead of amp
=> this is because in knobs params change, we process the noise knob at the and
=> will fix it later! (need click on knobs, to trigger mode, not param change)

- TODO: limit memory in SASFrame::Mult / Add / Mix? and MorphoSASMixer

- TODO(?): add a "strip" method to SASFrame7 (to remove debug data)
- TODO: add a "out gain" knob also for so panel

- TODO: for partials curve view: use a different method: keep only partials as data,
do not fill everything with zeros
(and so would be able to dr aw the envelope curve correctly)
- PROBLEM: tracking lines and detection points: not sticking exactly to line tops

- TODO: at the end, put all the classes from Morpho to bluelab-lib
(once the october release will be finished)
GhostTrack2 etc.
GhostTrack2: use it on Ghost, it should be the same as GhostTrack,
but better refactored
- TODO: at the end, generate AAX wrap id
