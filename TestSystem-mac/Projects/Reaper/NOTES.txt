- OLD: For 1 buffer size: 4H

- Every plugins, 1 test, 1 buffer size: 30mn
- Max: 7 tests, 6 buffer size => 42 tests => 24h
- 7 tests, 1 buffer size: 3h30
- 1 test, 6 buffer size: 3h

- Ghost-X: this is normal to have shifts in spectrograms depending on buffer size
(trigger of automation triggering render depend on buffer size)
- Precedence: this is normal to have some sorts of light clicks
- PitchShift: this is normal to have not exactly the same patterns in spectrograms depending on buffer size (automation on reaper seem to depend on buffer size)
