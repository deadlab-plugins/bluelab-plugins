This code was developed during around 3 years on a sofa, in a small and dark flat, close to a cemetery. With some neighbors randomly briefly shouting, night and day ... and the sound of the wind. Half of the code was written during 2020's virus lockdowns.
The power to do that came from:
- green tea
- chocolate squares
- and rarely seeing other humans in real, but with the company of a manifiscent and soft female cat, thanks to her, I miss her...
Sorry if you think that the code contains more or less wierdness, it was not so easy to go on.
